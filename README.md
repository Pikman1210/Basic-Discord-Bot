# Basic Discord Bot
 A basic discord bot for new users.
 
 This discord bot is free for anyone to use.
 
 To get started, create a new discord application, new bot user, and grab the token.
 Then replace "your-token-here" in config.json with the token.
 And replace "your-prefix-here" with the bot's prefix. ex. ~ping

 To add new commands, use the reference file and create a new .js file with the command's name. Then change the name and description of the new export. 
 Ta da! You've added a new command. Now you just need the code to execute.
