# Basic Discord Bot
 A basic discord bot for new users.
 
 This discord bot is free for anyone to use.
 
 To get started, create a new discord application, new bot user, and grab the token.
 Then replace "your-token-here" in config.json with the token.
 And replace "your-prefix-here" with the bot's prefix. ex. ~ping

 To add new commands, use the reference file and create a new .js file with the command's name. Then change the name and description of the new export. 
 Ta da! You've added a new command. Now you just need the code to execute.
 
 To invite your bot, go to OAuth2 of your discord application. Then select bot at the bottom then select the permissions you want.
 Then copy that, and replace "your invite here" in invite.js with that.
